# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# 100.times do
#   Post.create   title:  Faker::Hipster.sentence(5),
#                 body:   Faker::Hipster.paragraph

# 15.times do
#   Category.create(title: Faker::Hacker.adjective)
